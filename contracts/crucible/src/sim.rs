//! Transaction simulation: inspect-only dry-runs and commit-capable flows.
//!
//! Two distinct APIs are exposed so the state-mutation guarantees of each are
//! explicit and a commit closure never has to be carried around when it isn't
//! needed:
//!
//! * [`SimulatedTx`] — produced by [`MockEnv::simulate`](crate::env::MockEnv::simulate).
//!   A pure **inspection** of a call's fee, instruction count, required auths
//!   and result. It holds no closure and imposes no `'static` bound, so it can
//!   borrow freely from its surroundings and is cheap to pass around.
//!
//! * [`PreparedTx`] — produced by [`MockEnv::prepare`](crate::env::MockEnv::prepare).
//!   A **commit-capable** dry-run. It owns the call closure so the call can be
//!   re-executed and its state changes applied via [`PreparedTx::commit`]. The
//!   closure executes exactly twice across the prepare/commit flow: once during
//!   `prepare` (for the estimate) and once during `commit` (to apply state).
//!
//! Use `simulate` when you only want to *look* at what a call would do; use
//! `prepare`/`commit` when you intend to actually apply it after inspecting the
//! estimate.
